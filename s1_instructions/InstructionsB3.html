The computer will then randomly select one ball from the Mystery Bucket and show you the color of the ball. Each ball within the Mystery Bucket is equally likely to be selected.
<br>
<br>
Your task is to <b>report your Belief</b> about the percentage chance the ball came from Bucket A. You will report your Belief twice, <u>once before</u> seeing the color of the ball, and <u>then again after</u> seeing the color of the ball. The game ends after you see the color of the ball and report your second Belief.
