You will play this game 10 times. At the end of the experiment, only 1 of these 10 games will be randomly chosen by the computer to count for payment.
<br>
<br>
After the computer selects which game counts, we will then randomly choose whether the Belief you reported before or after seeing the ball will count to determine your actual bonus.
<br>
<br>
Note that this means that every Belief you report has the same chance of being selected to count to determine your payment.
<br>
<br>
We emphasize that this is a NO DECEPTION study. The computer will make the random draws and calculate your bonus behind the scenes following the procedures we described to you. You will not see any of the draws for any Belief you report until you finish playing the game 10 times.
<br>
<br>
Next, we will ask a series of questions to check your understanding of these instructions. You must answer all of the questions to advance to the task.
